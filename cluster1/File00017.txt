If you haven't heard about the romance brewing between Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra, you're probably living under a rock. The two seem to be the newest couple in town, and the internet can't get enough of them.

The dates seem to be getting more frequent. On Tuesday night, they were spotted at a dinner date, and on Wednesday, they met up for another lunch date.



Things are escalating fast between the couple now. They've been leaving flirtatious comments on each other's Instagram posts, much to the joy of their fans, who have nicknamed them Nickyanka.

Priyanka and Nick first sparked rumours when they arrived at last year's Met Gala together, both dressed in Ralph Lauren creations. Jimmy Kimmel took a dig at their age difference (she is 35, he is 25) on his show and asked Priyanka, "Are you dating Nick Jonas? Isn't he like, 11 years old?"

"We were both wearing Ralph Lauren and we decided to go together. It was fun. I didn't ask his age. Eleven?" she laughed, adding, "We were on the same table and we already know each other. So he was like 'Hey, you wanna go together?' And I was like 'Yeah, okay, let's go together.' It ended up working out."

The link-up rumours were reignited this year, when they spent the Memorial Day weekend with each other, starting with the Beauty and the Beast Live concert at the Hollywood Bowl, then catching a Los Angeles Dodgers game together and finally ending the weekend with a cosy yacht ride with their friends.
