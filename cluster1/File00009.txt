Celebrity influencer and new mum Kylie Jenner will no longer be sharing photos of her daughter Stormi’s face on social media - for an extremely troubling reason.

The 20-year-old beauty mogul, who gave birth to Stormi in February, kept her pregnancy private for the duration - only announcing the news of her daughter after she’d given birth.

Since then, Jenner had proudly shown off her daughter on social media. But after deleting all existing photos of her daughter’s face, an insider told People that Jenner had had enough of the “nasty” comments people were leaving.

“Kylie felt so protective of her baby when she was pregnant. This is why she didn’t share any bump pictures while she was pregnant. After Stormi was born, Kylie was the proudest mum.

“She couldn’t wait to show off Stormi to her fans. She posted pictures, because she was so excited to be a mum. Unfortunately, social media is a crazy place. People have been making nasty comments.

“Kylie is shocked and doesn’t want her daughter’s pictures to be a part of something negative. She might reconsider in the future, but for now, she won’t post any more photos of Stormi’s face,” the source said.

Following the Instagram purge of photos, fans were quick to notice Stormi’s absence, especially in one picture where the young mum had cropped her daughter’s face out.

Responding to a comment about the cropped photo, Jenner defended her decision, stating: “Yeah I cut my baby out. I’m not sharing photos of my girl right now.”

Despite surprise over Jenner’s choice to keep Stormi out of the spotlight, the Kylie Cosmetics founder has previously discussed the idea of keeping her life more private once she had a child.

“Once I have a kid I’m not going to be on Instagram. You know, I’ll probably delete my Instagram and just... I don’t know, live life,” Jenner told Elle in 2016.
