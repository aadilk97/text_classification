Taylor Swift helped kick off Pride Month with a touching speech during her reputation Tour!

The 28-year-old superstar opened up during her concert on Saturday night (June 2) in Chicago, Ill.

“It’s very brave to be vulnerable about your feelings in any sense, in any situation. But it’s even more brave to be honest about your feelings and who you love and that you know that that might be met with adversity from society,” Taylor began.

She continued, “So this month and every month I want to send out my love and respect to everybody who has been brave enough to be honest about the way they feel, to live their lives as they are, as they feel they should be, as they identify. And this is a month where I think we need to celebrate how far we’ve come but we also need to acknowledge how far we still have left to go.”

“And I want to send my love and respect out to everybody who in their journey hasn’t yet felt comfortable enough to come out and may you do that in your own time. May we end up in a world where everyone can live and love equally and no one has to be afraid to be vulnerable and say how they feel,” Taylor concluded.
