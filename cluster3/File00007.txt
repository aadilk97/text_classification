Rafael Nadal has been hitting with Jaume Munar ahead of Wimbledon

Nadal, 32, pulled out of Queen’s this week after a gruelling clay-court campaign.

And there will be fresh doubt over whether Nadal is ready for Wimbledon after his doctor was spotted at the Mallorca Open practice courts.

Tennis World say Angel Ruiz Cotorro was on court to closely looking at Nadal’s movements.

Nadal won his 11th French Open title earlier this month but pulled out of Queen’s because he needed to rest before next month's Wimbledon.

"I have spoken to my doctors and need to listen to what my body is telling me," the Spaniard said.

"I would like to say sorry to the tournament organisers and the fans that were hoping to see me play."
