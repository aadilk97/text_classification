AB De Villiers is known for his brilliant batting skills worldwide and is a player who can change the complexion of a game within seconds. But we all are no stranger to the fact that apart from his batting skills, fielding is also a department in which the South African excels.

The cricketer has been a consistent performer for the Royal Challenger’s Bangalore this season with the willow though RCB’s bowling has not been up to the mark. But yesterday against the Sunrisers Hyderabad AB De Villiers did something in the field which has made us believe more in the saying that nothing is impossible.

The Proteas player took a blinder in the field to dismiss Alex Hales who was looking quite dangerous with the bat having hit three sixes and two boundaries already. The catch was taken in the 8th over which brought an end to hales’ innings much to the joy of the RCB supporters.

Even Virat Kohli, the RCB skipper, could not stop himself from comparing De Villiers to Superman on Twitter. Kohli, however, dropped two catches in the match which is quite unlikely of the brilliant fielder. RCB went on to win the match at the end by 14 runs which kept their playoff hopes alive.
