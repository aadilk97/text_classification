During the 51st match of the 11th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at Bengaluru, Royal Challengers Bangaloreâ€™s AB de Villiers got hold of an implausible catch to dismiss Alex Hales.

After Kane Williamson, captain of Sunrisers Hyderabad, won the toss and put the hosts in to bat, they lost their openers cheaply in the powerplay. In a situation where Bangalore desperately needed a partnership, AB de Villiers and Moeen Ali stitched a 107-run stand for the third wicket. The partnership came off 57 balls as both the batsmen scored brisk half-centuries.

It happened on the last delivery of the eighth over when Hales hit a Moeen Ali delivery towards the deep mid-wicket region. The ball appeared to cross the boundary with ease. However, AB de Villiers leapfrogged to grab the ball out of thin air. Whilst in the air, he stuck out his right hand to complete the catch.

As far as fielding is concerned, it is that sort of a night tonight. In Shikhar Dhawan, Rashid Khan, Tim Southee and de Villiers, this match has witnessed four breadth-taking catches. However, only two of them were ruled out because Dhawan and third-umpire C Shamsuddin committed mistakes which saw a change in the decision.
