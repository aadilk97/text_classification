Virat Kohli had said in the pre-match press conference on Friday that he would play the Test only if he is 100 percent fit. “The injury has an element of being aggravated in the field. While batting, there is no discomfort,” Kohli had said. (4th Day 1 Scorecard)

This is the first time that Virat Kohli has missed a Test in his career due to injury. Since the West Indies series in November 2011, he had played 54 consecutive Tests before the game in Dharamsala.

The Indian skipper sustained the injury to his right shoulder in the Ranchi Test when he looked to stop a boundary at wide long on. He dived but he landed heavily on his right shoulder which forced him to be off the field for a long period of time.

Kohli has been in poor form in the series against Australia, managing scores of just 0,13,12,15 and 6 in the three Tests.

The four-match series is currently tied 1-1.
