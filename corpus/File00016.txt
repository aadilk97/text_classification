Djokovic became only the 10th player to win 800 matches and he joins an exclusive club which includes Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Federer has the second most wins of all time with 1,156 victories – exactly 100 behind Jimmy Connors - while Nadal has won 903.

Djokovic reached his milestone in style by coming from an early break down to beat Adrian Mannarino 7-5, 6-1.

And he has no plans of stopping playing any time soon.

“It's a milestone, and of course it's a great achievement,” Djokovic said.
