Federer extended his unbeaten record on grass to 19 consecutive matches with a straight sets win over Matthew Ebden earlier today. But it was far from a comfortable match for the 20-time Grand Slam champion as he had to come back from a break down in the second set. He now remains on course to win a 10th title in Halle but will have to get past American Kudla in their semi-final showdown tomorrow in order to set up a final against either Borna Coric or Roberto Bautista-Agut. And Federer is expecting a tough outing, but is confident of progressing to the final.

“I’ve played him once before in Indian Wells. He’s a good player. I thought he did some great ball-striking today against Sugita,” Federer told the ATP World Tour. “Very sound off the ground, great forehands and backhands, flat and deep and he also uses the slice to good effect and the grass always helps the server. “Maybe we’ll see more rallies tomorrow so it’s going to be more physical for me but also give me a bit more chances because I will have a little bit more time.” Federer hasn’t had an easy route to the final four at the Halle Open, but the 36-year-old was pleased with his overall game against Ebden.

“I was just very happy that in the bigger moments I actually served alright and I actually also returned very well when I had to,” Federer said. “Maybe his serve let him down ever so slightly in the bigger moments and he had the break twice in the second set so he should bring that home somehow. “But to break him three times in the second set is going to give me some confidence for the next match.”
