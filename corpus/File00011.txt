Roger Federer has admitted he is feeling the strain of playing so many matches in quick succession

The world No 1 was made to work hard against Matthew Ebden of Australia in his last-eight clash at Halle, where he is hoping to retain his crown and win a 10th title.

The 36-year-old added a 19th consecutive grass-court win as he came out on top 6-2, 7-5.

Federer’s imperious run of form on his favourite surface saw him triumph at the Stuttgart Open last week as well as having won at Wimbledon for an eighth time 12 months ago.

But despite a three-month break as he once again skipped the clay-court season, the six matches he had played in nine days before facing Ebden, twice being taken to three sets, appeared to take its toll.

Especially after being taken to three sets in a match just shy of two hours against Benoit Paire the day before, requiring a decisive tiebreaker in the third set.

Federer must win in Halle to stay No 1 over rival Rafael Nadal going into the tour’s next Grand Slam at SW19 at the start of July.
