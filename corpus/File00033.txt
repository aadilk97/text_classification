The landslide wins for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand will embolden Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take more harsh and sudden economic steps.Perhaps not sure if the masses had supported demonetisation, PM Modi played down his controversial move during the election campaign.But the stunning victory in Uttar Pradesh, the largest and one of the poorest states, has removed all doubts about demonetisation. This huge affirmation will encourage Modi to take more controversial steps.A few days after announcing demonetisation, Modi said this to his political opponents in a public speech: “If you haven’t realised what I am made of, then do now. I will dig into your records dating back to when India achieved its independence. I will give jobs to 100,000 youths and ask them to do this work.”Modi said demonetisation was not the end of his agenda and he was planning to take more such steps.On such step he had promised was action against benami property. Though the government has already started to act against benami accounts and properties, the move has not assumed the magnitude of a crackdown. After the UP victory, PM Modi can turn it into a major campaign.He might decide to target the big fish in the opposition parties.Now that he need not bother about popular support, he can even take more innovative and controversial financial decisions. Another encouraging factor for him will be the sweeping victory in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand ensuring enough numbers for the BJP in the Rajya Sabha. This will change the current situation when many Bills get stuck in the upper house for lack of numbers.One bold step by PM Modi could be merging all government subsidies such as on kerosene and power into the direct benefits transfer scheme so that there is no leakage due to corruption and all the money reaches the beneficiaries.An idea that has been associated a lot with Modi's radical reforms is a banking transaction tax, replacing the income tax entirely or partly. This move can be more controversial than even demonetisation. But it seems Modi, buoyed by electoral victories, can go for it.Other measures he has spoken a lot about are holding Assembly and Lok Sabha elections simultaneously and state funding of elections. He will now find the courage to work on these too.
