South African cricket superstar AB de Villiers has called time on his international career after more than a decade at the top of the sport.

The batsman released a statement on social media on Wednesday, declaring he was "tired" and it was time to step aside.

"I want to let you know that I've decided to retire from all international cricket, with immediate effect," de Villiers said in the video message.

"After 114 Test matches, 228 one day internationals and 78 T20 internationals, it is time for others to take over.

"I've had my turn and to be honest, I'm tired.

"This is a tough decision, I've thought long and hard about it and I'd like to retire while still playing decent cricket and, after the fantastic series wins against India and Australia, now feels the right time to step aside."

The 34-year-old said he didn't want to pick and choose which formats to represent the Proteas, that it was "everything or nothing".

"To cricket fans around South Africa, and the world, thank you for your kindness, your generosity, and today, your understanding"

De Villiers finishes up with 8765 Test runs at an average of 50.66, as well as 9577 ODI runs at an incredible average of 53.5.

He holds the record for the fastest ODI century, smashing a ton off 31 balls against West Indies in 2015.

The decision comes on the back of some of the best form of his career, demolishing Australia's attack on the recent tour, scoring 477 runs at 71.16.

De Villiers said he would continue playing domestic cricket, but did not comment on whether he would play in T20 tournaments internationally.
