Novak Djokovic is through to the semi-finals at Queen's

Roger Federer and Rafael Nadalâ€™s dominance on the sport is the reason Djokovic does not get as much credit as he should, the BBC tennis pundit added.

Federer and Nadal have tallied 36 Grand Slam wins between them in well over a decade of being the top stars on tour.

Meanwhile, Djokovic has won 12 major tournaments, with most coming between 2011 and 2015.

But Castle thinks if it was not for the current top two players in the world then Djokovic would be held in much higher esteem.
