If you're seeing a weird link at the top of your Facebook newsfeed today, it may mean your personal data has been leaked. From today, Facebook will be providing all users with details of the apps they're using/have used in the past, as well as what data they could have collected. Facebook is also expected to start notifying some of the 87 million users (most of whom reside in the United States) whose data was "improperly shared" and used by a company allegedly targeting users with political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Facebook shares user data all the time — when you log into Instagram using your Facebook account, for example, Instagram gets that data. Last month, a whistleblower came forward to say that Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining firm, allegedly improperly accessed Facebook user data through a third-party quiz app, and it used that data to build psychological profiles to target voters with political ads. Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing.

It's a big deal because it means that roughly 87 million people's personal information was maybe used to sway their vote. If Cambridge Analytica was able to put certain ads into specific people's feeds, it could have influenced their political views — Facebook users were served (at times misleading) ads that related to issues they felt strongly about, and that were designed to provoke a reaction — and a share.

To add another layer to the controversy, Cambridge Analytica has ties to some of President Trump's biggest donors. Rebekah Mercer, who owns the right-wing media outlet Breitbart News, sits on the board, for example. She donated heavily to Trump's campaign. This scandal comes amid a conversation amongst lawmakers that Facebook didn't do enough to combat fake news during the election.

You can be proactive and check whether your data was leaked before the warning link appears in your timeline or you get a notification about it. Use this tool that Facebook released yesterday to find out, there are more in-depth instructions on how to interpret the results here. From there, you can choose which apps have your information and which ones don't, which limits the chance for leaking.

You can also explore Facebook's Privacy Settings to learn about the ways you're protected and the ways you're not. In regards to Cambridge Analytica specifically though, there's not much to do, considering the actual data leak took place over a year ago.
