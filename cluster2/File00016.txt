NEW DELHI: The need to maintain plurality that former President Pranab Mukherjee stressed upon, while addressing the Tritiya Sangh Shiksha Varg event in Nagpur last week, is "exactly what the RSS has been promoting for years and it is what the Hindu religion too symbolises" — this is what RSS-inspired magazines Organiser and Panchajanya have talked about in their recent editions which have covered and analysed the June 7 event.Both magazines stressed that what Mukherjee and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat spoke had many similarities.The editorial in Organiser written by its editor Prafulla Ketkar said the real message from the visit was "more national than political.""The social acceptance of this ‘natural self’ of Bharat further gets strengthened with presence and encouragement from experienced and scholarly public figure like Dr Mukherjee," the edit said.The editorial also said that while generally, in RSS functions, the RSS chief delivered the last address, in this particular case, Mukherjee was given the opportunity to speak last.Panchajanya called the visit by Mukherjee "a win for plurality, the ethos that Hinduism promotes".Written by author Ratan Sharda , the article said plurality stressed upon by Mukherjee was what Hinduism promotes, unlike religions such as Islam or Christianity who "believe their truth is the only truth"."Sangh did not expect him to pat its back or speak its language, but what he said is a lot similar to what the sangh preaches. And, he said all this staying in the limits of being a Congressman," the cover story said."The visit also is a start to the end of intellectual untouchability," it said, also making a mention of how it was courageous of sangh leaders to call Mukherjee, a veteran Congressman, to the event, a gesture that it said was much needed in times like this.Mukherjee's talk of reducing violence and intolerance in the society was a message to those who promote terrorism, anti-national activities and Naxalites, the article said.Organiser's cover piece by political writer Virah Pachpore, while reporting all that the former President spoke on the need to end violence of all kinds, the importance of ancient values and the significance of nationalism among other issues, also pointed out that Mukherjee "concluded his speech with ‘Vande Mataram’, an anathema to the Congress party and the Islamists in this country".Another article by Sandeep Singh, called "An address to Bharat", said Mukherjee's "ultimate praise and belief in RSS were reflected in his words — ‘You are young, disciplined, well trained and highly educated. Please wish for peace, harmony and happiness. Our Motherland deserves that," and that there could not have been a better speech to conclude Tritiya Varsha Sangh Shiksha Varg of RSS.Pranab Mukherjee, the article said, presented his vision for India which "only the RSS can fulfil.""He accepted the invite because he wanted to make a speech which could have been made only from the RSS platform," Singh wrote.The piece also pointed out that apart from the word "minority," other omissions from the speech of Mukherjee were names of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and the Congress party."He mentioned the Congress party but that was of before independence. Mukherjee is a Nehruvian Congressmen, the same Nehru which had invited RSS to the Republic Day Parade. He has seen the Congress and its leaders’ hatred for RSS, Hindus and India from close quarters and may be that is the reason he avoided mentioning them,” it said in the concluding parts.
